  **Description** The Arbon protocol is an oracle-based issuer of carbon offset tokens (COT) issued on Solana based on AI-assisted detection of carbon sequestration across woodlands. This MVP utilizes satellite imagery from across the Amazon rainforest, minting the carbon sequestration power of this massive forest into an on-chain real-world global asset (RWGA). Arbon encapsulates the entire carbon credit lifecycle from creation to offset and increases efficiency manifold.
