  **Description:** We're a [[Solana]]-native regenerative finance platform, empowering people to invest in our planet. 
  
  We curate opportunities to finance climate projects & earn a return on investment. Our product in development is The ReeFi Hub. 
  
  We're also an NFT community with an Impact Fund, called the Tribe Fund. With our fund, we match investments which meet certain criteria. Our investment interests are within SDG Goals 12 & 14. All Tribe Fund investment rewards are shared with Coral Tribe NFT holders.
