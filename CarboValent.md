  **Description** Carbovalentâ€™s mission is to accelerate the advent of a Net-Zero future by unlocking scale for the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM). Carbovalent is building technology to power carbon assets and their regenerative finance (ReFi) applications on Solana, an environmentally-efficient proof-of-stake network. We aim to integrate the carbon market on-chain and provide unrestricted access to carbon assets through transparent means of sourcing, bridging, trading, and retiring tokenized carbon credits.
