  **Description:** Welcome to the Islands of Cool, the internet's coolest climate action corporation.
  Creators of the Digital Carbon Sponge™, a super efficient smart contract that captures real world carbon at mint and in perpetuity. 
  The more a Digital Carbon Sponge™ is traded the cooler it becomes. Built in royalties allow each and every trade to purchase additional carbon removal, which is then fed back to the Digital Carbon Sponge™ via our carbon bridge. 
  
  The result is the world's coolest NFTs and action that once started, cannot be stopped. Kickstarting a new standard for smart contracts and how we cool our planet.
