  **Description:** Consumer-facing vehicle for environmental entities doing stuff in web3 and grow the IP to bring value to the community. NFT project that Dana said is awesome.
  **Founders**Kiro
  **Internal POC:**Amira
  **[[Solana]] Connection:**Deciding where to build
  **Status:**Not yet live
  **Notes **Planning to launch at the end of October. Had a call on 9-27-22. Komori is creating a global IP.  It's an amazing opportunity for [[Solana]] to position itself as the carbon neutral chain. Sustainability is one of the biggest deterrents to onboarding young people on blockchain. Our project's focus is to eradicate the environmental of stigma into web3. WE want to onboard the biggest names in environmentalism into web3 - WWF, the water project, etc. Uses blockchain to simplify and gamify environmental action. Plant 162 trees every time you mint a Komori.
